# Jumpstart
A game I'm coding to practice handling animations smoothly and consistantly in JMonkeyEngine.

## Dependencies
* JMonkeyEngine
* Lemur
* Minie
* J3map
* JmeUtilityLibrary (for now, this library will probably be deprecated and replaced with something else)
* [Jumpstart Assets](https://github.com/codex128/JumpstartAssetKit) (code would have to be modified to point to where these assets are stored).
